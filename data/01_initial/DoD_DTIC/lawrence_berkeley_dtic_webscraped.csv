0,Printable Integrated Photonic Devices,United States Department of the Air Force,to Christophe Peroz,"ABSTRACT: aBeam Technologies, Inc. proposes a new printing technology for fabricating photonic devices. This nanofabrication process could potentially reduce to a single step, the fabrication of photonic crystals by direct imprinting on inorganic materials. The method is low cost and suitable for large-scale areas. In Phase I, the demonstration of feasibility of the method provides the basis for fabricating a new class of quantum-dot nanolasers in Phase II. BENEFIT: Our approach will revolutionize the fabrication of nanophotonic components and will allow development of new photonic devices. The first targeted application will be a new class of quantum-dot nanolaser arrays. It will then be expanded into other areas of photonic applications, such as for displays. The method promises to enable the development of many other nanophotonic applications.less","750,000",2014,2016

0,"Wide Area Distributed Algorithms for Cooperative Source Identification, Characterization, and Localization",Defense Threat Reduction Agency,to William Ford,"Current radiation detection algorithms are based on the concept that each detector operates independently. The Probitas Project, Inc. (Probitas) and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) propose to show the benefits of data fusion to improve the identification, localization, and characterization of a radioactive source in a complex scene as compared to a singular detector algorithm. We will develop flexible, multi-radiation detector algorithms that can be deployed across radiation detection networks to enable the linking of multiple detector variants and fusing of raw detector outputs into usable information. Our data-driven approach utilizes currently available data to investigate multi-input neural networks and network architectures for identification and anomaly detection to achieve improved performance metrics for low statistics measurements. We will also extend current point estimation and tracking technologies to localize a source faster and/or with fewer detections using a multi-sensor network.less","167,493",2022,2023
0,Quench Monitoring and Control System for High-Temperature Superconducting Coils,United States Department of the Navy,to Danko van der Laan Danko van der Laan,"The Navy has been developing superconducting systems, based on high-temperature superconductors (HTS), for future use on Navy ships. One of the challenges associated with superconducting magnets is the possibility of a quench, which is an event where a local hot spot develops within the superconductor that quickly spreads throughout the device, driving it into its normal and dissipative state. Sensitive, high-speed quench detection and control systems are required to ensure safe operation to allow superconducting systems to transition onto Navy platforms. The program aims to develop active acoustic emission quench detection and control systems for HTS magnets and other superconducting devices for naval applications. The Phase I program focuses on developing Navy-specific quench detection hardware and demonstrate their performance on small superconducting coils. The system should respond within 80 ms of the onset of a quench, even in the presence of noise and vibrations that may be present on a Navy ship. The Phase II program would result in a quench detection and control system, based on active acoustic quench detection, that has been fully tested and verified to meet relevant military shock and vibration standards by the end of the Phase II - Option I program.less","140,000",2019,2020
0,Windable Lithium-ion Conducting Ceramic Membranes,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Lisen Cheng,"There is a strong need to develop low cost, windable lithium-ion conducting ceramic membranes for high energy and power density Li air battery applications. Collaborating with a leading Li battery research group at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in this program, NanoGreen Solutions (NGS) proposes an innovative windable lithium-ion conducting ceramic membranes with unprecedented performance such as windability and high Li ion conductivity (>1 mS/cm). The proposed composite membrane consists of high Li-ion conductive ceramic fibers and cross-linkable Li-ion conductive polymer. The proposed ceramic polymer membranes presents a promising approach to realize a new generation Li air battery to fulfill the energy storage needs for various applications ranging from dismounted warriors to electric vehicles.

0,"Radiation-Hard, High Efficiency InP/InN Tandem Cells",Missile Defense Agency,to Steven Wojtczuk,"Spire proposes to investigate InP/InN tandem solar cells for applications where extreme radiation-hardness is needed. Indium phosphide (InP) has proven itself as a radiation-hard cell material, and indium nitride (InN) has shown superior radiation resistance to 2MeV protons. InP (1.34 eV) and InN (0.7eV) bandgaps allow current-matching (38 mA/cm2) under the AM0 spectrum, enabling two-terminal operation. We will investigate use of a pseudomorphic InGaP window to boost InP top cell efficiency from its current 19% one-sun AM0 level to 22%. We describe a process that allows the InP top cell to be undisturbed by dislocations from the InN growth. The 0.7eV InN bottom cell has an upper efficiency limit of ~9% AM0; however, the growth of InN would introduce substantial dislocations, and its efficiency would likely be about 4%. However, the dislocations should not compromise the InN radiation hardness, and we believe that the proposed research should lead to tandem space cells with efficiencies of ~26% (1 sun AM0, 25C) which would be flat in power output to fluences beyond 1e16 1MeV electrons/cm2.less","99,931",2004,2005
0,An automated and programmable microfluidic platform for combinatorial gene assembly and biosynthesis applications,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,to Michael Pollack,"HJ Science & Technology (HJS & T) and the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) propose to develop an automated, software-controlled, programmable, low-cost, and compact platform capable of running rapid and complex bioengineering processes and optimization of new biomanufacturing systems. Our approach combines the microfluidic automation technology of HJS & T with the novel synthetic biology technologies of combinatorial gene library generation, host transfection, and gene product screening at JBEI. Compared with conventional approaches, the integrated microfluidic technology has these advantages: 1) on-chip automation, eliminating the need for bulky and expensive sample handling robots, 2) small volume, reducing reagent consumption, and 3) multifunctional integration on a microchip level. In Phase I, we will establish the feasibility of the microfluidic automation technology by performing 1) construction of a combinatorial library of Green Fluorescent Protein and Red Fluorescent Protein gene expression cassettes, and 2) subsequent transformation into yeast cells/chromosomal integration and screening of expression products, on the same microfluidic chip in a fully automated format. In Phase II, we will realize a fully automated and programmable platform for the biological design-build-test cycle that encompasses 4 basic steps: 1) software DNA design; 2) DNA synthesis and assembly; 3) transfection/chromosomal integration and product screening; and 4) real-time feedback and control.less","99,912",2013,2013

The demonstration at Los Angeles Air Force Base, California, will enable DoD fleet managers to schedule charging and discharging of electric vehicles to take optimal economic advantage of demand response and ancillary services (DR+AS) markets, while ensuring the vehicles operate in conjunction with other base electrical loads and generation resources to maintain energy security and a minimal carbon footprint at the installation.less",2012,‐,
0,A Multisensor System for the Detection and Characterization of UXO,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Erika Gasperikova,"The objective of this project was to demonstrate that a multi-sensor active electromagnetic (AEM) system can be built to detect and extract essential information about a metallic object in the ground so as to discriminate unexploded ordnance (UXO)-like bodies from non-UXO scrap. The demonstration was conducted as part of the ESTCP UXO Discrimination Study, which was designed to test and validate UXO detection and discrimination capabilities of currently available and emerging technologies on real sites under operational conditions. In addition, the ESTCP Office and their demonstrators investigated, in cooperation with regulators and program managers, how UXO discrimination technologies can be implemented in cleanup operations.less",Summarize,,
0,Detection and Classification of Buried Metallic Objects,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Frank Morrison,"Building on an earlier SERDP SEED project (), this project sought to design an optimum active electromagnetic (EM) system that can extract, from the measurements, the best possible estimates of the location, depth, size, shape and metal content of a buried metallic object in the presence of the interfering response of non-unexploded ordnance (UXO) metallic objects. Discrimination can be achieved through selective filtering of the response inherent to the system design followed by post acquisition data processing. The parameters of the object are obtained by an inversion of the measurements to establish the principal EM moments of the detected object. These are never determined perfectly because of a fundamental non-uniqueness in the solutions (the response of the target) to the governing diffusion equation. Limitations introduced by depth of the target, the response of the ground, and the presence of other non-UXO metallic objects combine with constraints of weight and power considerations to restrict what is achievable. An optimum system is bounded by these theoretical and practical considerations and, in the end, represents a compromise that detects, discriminates, and classifies to an agreed upon specification.The project performed basic research to develop a systematic approach for the design and fabrication of an optimum active EM system based on the methodology employed in the minerals exploration industry in the search for metallic ore bodies. The intent of the optimum system, bounded by practical and theoretical limitations, is to detect, discriminate, and classify buried ordnance.less",Summarize,,
0,Handheld UXO Discriminator,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Erika Gasperikova,"Because handheld systems are lightweight, compact, portable, and deployable under most site conditions, they are particularly useful in areas of dense vegetation or challenging terrain. In heavily wooded areas or areas with steep or uneven terrain, handheld sensors may be the only suitable device for UXO detection and discrimination because they can be carried through spaces that the operator can walk through or at least approach. Furthermore, it is desirable to find and characterize a metallic object without the need to accurately locate the sensors at multiple positions around the target. The ideal system would thus locate and characterize the target from a single position of the sensor and indicate to the operator where to flag the target for subsequent study. The objective of this project was to design and build a prototype handheld UXO discriminator.less",2009,‐,
0,Handheld BUD Demonstration,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Erika Gasperikova,"This project will demonstrate and validate the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory (LBNL) handheld UXO discriminator as part of the live site demonstration at the former Camp Beale. This research instrument was designed under SERDP project and is the direct descendant of the original Berkley UXO Discriminator (BUD) developed under ESTCP project . The handheld UXO discriminator (14-in (0.35 m) cube) has been designed to discriminate small (20 mm) objects at depths up to 0.45 m and large (105 and 155 mm) objects at depths up to 0.85 m and to detect targets at depths up to 1.15 m.

0,Modified Activated Carbon Perchlorate Sorbents,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Wayne Lukens,"Perchlorate contamination of ground and surface water has occurred at a number of sites, principally in the western United States. The contamination is a result of historical activities such as previously acceptable disposal procedures and the testing of solid rocket motors. The health effects of low exposure levels to perchlorate are not well known, but state action levels for perchlorate in drinking water are as low as 1 part per billion. The responsibility for perchlorate remediation at many of these sites falls to the Department of Defense, and the development of innovative remedial approaches has been an active area of research. The most widely used approach for perchlorate remediation is ion exchange using strong-base anion exchange resins and traditional pump-and-treat technology. One drawback is the relatively low perchlorate selectivity of commercial resins, which renders a large fraction of their anion exchange capacity unusable. Highly selective anion exchange resins have been prepared, but they are much more expensive. Bioremediation by perchlorate-reducing bacteria is an attractive approach for the in-situ degradation of perchlorate in groundwater; however, it is ineffective if other electron acceptors, especially oxygen and nitrate, are present.The primary research objective was to modify activated carbon by creating additional quaternary ammonium sites and measure the capacity and selectivity of these activated carbons for perchlorate adsorption. The secondary research objective was to determine whether granular modified activated carbon (GMAC) anion exchange materials could be prepared using only gaseous reagents under conditions similar to those used to prepare conventional gas-activated carbon.less",Summarize,,
0,Determining the Temporal and Spatial Scales of Nonstationarity in Temperature and Precipitation across the Continental United States for a Given Emissions Scenario,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Daniel Feldman,"The means and extremes of surface air temperature and precipitation have changed significantly in the last 50 years, and may change more in the 21st Century. These changes may be without a historical analogue, and this nonstationarity presents a challenge for Department of Defense (DoD) infrastructure planning and operations, wherein historical distributions are used as the basis for managing infrastructure and operations risk from flooding, drought, heat waves, and other weather phenomena. The objective of this project was to use a combination of climate models, observations, and analysis to develop robust, defensible projections of the range of distributions of temperature and precipitation that DoD infrastructure and operations will face.less",2018,‐,
0,Developing Smart Infrastructure for a Changing Arctic Environment Using Distributed Fiber-Optic Sensing Methods,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Jonathan Ajo-Franklin,"Permafrost environments are a unique setting for built infrastructure, an environment in which small thermal perturbations can have dramatic impacts on structural stability ranging from foundation settling to catastrophic failure of roads, bridges, and runways due to thermokarst generation. A substantial global temperature change is expected within the next century with a higher degree of variability predicted in arctic regions (approximately 4°C) where substantial Department of Defense (DoD) resources are currently located. The non-linear coupling of future changes in air temperature, surface insolation, and surface/subsurface hydrology to soil mechanics generates a high degree of uncertainty as to the environmental changes that built infrastructure will actually experience.The objective of this project is to develop and validate a fiber-optic geophysical sensing package capable of providing real-time information on subsurface conditions relevant to infrastructure performance and failure in permafrost environments. The system will consist of a combination of three fiber-based distributed sensing methods—distributed temperature sensing (DTS), distributed strain sensing (DSS), and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)—designed to be embedded in, or near, built infrastructure and to detect regions of progressive permafrost thaw induced by subsurface flow, surface water accumulation, or changes in system thermal behavior. Seismic noise generated by infrastructure utilization (e.g., planes, automobiles, and railway activity) will be measured by DAS and inverted to generate real-time shear modulus profiles across the length of the installed component. Pre-failure deformation will be measured using DSS, allowing characterization of the early phases of consolidation. These profiles will be coupled to DTS-detected thermal perturbations to identify zones likely to be experiencing thawing and to flag such regions for inspection before infrastructure failure occurs. The resulting information will be provided on a quasi-real time basis to system decision-makers for incorporation into maintenance planning.less",2014,‐,
0,Demonstration of the Berkeley UXO Discriminator at Live Sites,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Erika Gasperikova,"Testing of discrimination technology has been primarily limited to test sites, with little application at live sites. For discrimination technologies to be validated they must be demonstrated at real sites with unexploded ordnance (UXO) and real world conditions. ESTCP has invested in munitions response demonstration and validation efforts to understand the applicability and limitations of these pilot technologies at live sites under the Live Site Program. ESTCP has also assembled an Advisory Group to address the regulatory, programmatic, and stakeholder acceptance issues associated with the implementation of discrimination in the munitions response process. The continued involvement of regulators within the demonstration process aids technology development and relevance for decision makers.The two primary demonstration objectives of this study were to (1) determine the discrimination capabilities of the Berkely UXO Discriminator (BUD) at San Luis Obispo (SLO), California, and (2) investigate, in cooperation with regulators and program managers, how discrimination technologies can be implemented in cleanup operations.less",2009,‐,

0,Weather Effects on the Lifecycle of DoD Equipment Replacement (WELDER): A Plug-in for the BUILDER Sustainment Management System,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Peter Larsen,"Given increasing threats of extreme weather events, facility planners and policymakers need state-of-the-art information that projects long-term environmental risk and informs how these events may alter the replacement schedules and the performance profiles of individual facilities and their constituent systems and components. The BUILDER Sustainment Management System (SMS)—the lifecycle management tool used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to consistently and comprehensively assess and forecast facility conditions—did not consider vulnerability to extreme weather events. This project involved developing a plug-in for BUILDER that allows users to visualize weather event projections and re-prioritize infrastructure maintenance and/or replacement schedules, and assess costs, according to the likelihood and severity of these events.less",2019,‐,

0,Integrated Resilient Node Hardware and Supervisory Control for Phased Microgrid Installation at Military Facilities,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Doug Black,"There are multiple challenges that military facilities face in implementing islandable microgrids with one of the most, if not the most, significant being cost. Currently bases consider the capability to island only at the point of common coupling with the utility grid in case of a grid outage, which requires larger more expensive power electronics. Renewable energy goals and a desire for greater on-site power generation and lower dependence on diesel fuel for back-up generators requires installation of photovoltaic (PV) panels, battery energy storage systems (BESSs) or other distributed energy resources (DER). Due to their scale, full-base microgrids require more costly design, review, approval, and permitting costs along with much greater DER and power electronic costs. The technology proposed here will enable a base to implement smaller microgrids that provide resilience for critical and non-critical loads in a staged approach that lowers costs and spreads those costs out over longer periods. The main objectives of this project are to:less",2020,‐,
0,Automated Scenario Assessment of Groundwater Table & Salinity Response to Sea-level Rise,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Dipankar Dwivedi,"More than 1700 Department of Defense (DoD) sites in coastal areas worldwide are expected to be impacted by rising sea levels. Decisions regarding the management of these high-value military installations near and along the coast depend on the accuracy with which changes to groundwater levels and salinity can be predicted under realistic future conditions. A major challenge for decision-makers is that high-fidelity mechanistic models that relate the rising sea level to groundwater level rises and salinity intrusion are inevitably site specific, expensive to build, and difficult to use. To address these concerns, the objective of this project is to develop a flexible, transparent, efficient, and user-friendly toolset with multiple reduced-order models (ROMs) that can be employed by non-expert personnel to quickly estimate changes in groundwater levels and salinity intrusion using simplified representations of site-specific data. The novel scientific contribution of the project is the evaluation of a range of strategies to create the ROMs, including proper orthogonal decomposition, machine learning approaches, and high-fidelity mechanistic models, to identify which type of ROM best approximates the groundwater levels and water quality (salinity) at a variety of coastal sites. The resulting end product will be a risk management summary for site managers that carefully evaluates multiple ROM choices, thereby capturing the range of responses for groundwater levels and saltwater encroachment expected under a changing climate.less",2022,‐,
0,Thermal Reservoir Networks for Modularly Expandable Thermal Microgrids,Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Michael Wetter,"This project will conduct a detailed techno-economic feasibility analysis to identify fossil-free, cost-effective, resilient, and robust technology options that serve simultaneous heating and cooling requirements of co-located buildings, and that are applicable for a range of Department of Defense (DoD) sites. This project will analyze a thermal reservoir network; a thermal microgrid that uses a water distribution loop that operates at near-ambient temperature. This distribution loop will be coupled to local environment thermal sources, sinks and storage, and to energy transfer stations with reversible heat pumps that are located in the buildings. The design will improve energy resilience through load shifting and controlled dispatch of technology. This project will demonstrate annual system-level performance through simulations, targeting a seasonal performance factor of 6-8, a 20-30% peak load shaving and 50% power reduction over resilience events, with life cycle costs under $0.20/kWh. The thermal reservoir network is modularly expandable.

This will be achieved by documenting and disseminating technology transfer solutions that will provide a set of “work-through” pathways to implement different types of EMIS more rapidly, along with a package of tailored guidance materials.The DoD has already documented the benefits of EMIS through past and ongoing ESTCP demonstration projects. With aggressive energy savings mandates and an Army Installations Strategy driving toward modern, resilient, sustainable operations, EMIS can form a central pillar of efficient building operations.

0,"Weather Effects on the Lifecycle of DoD Equipment Replacement (WELDER) 2.0: Climate Change Impacts on DoD Infrastructure Condition, Lifecycle, and Cost",Office of the Secretary of Defense,to Peter Larsen,"Climate change and extreme weather cause catastrophic damage to the Department of Defense’s (DoD) mission critical facilities, potentially interrupting military operations both domestically and abroad. It has been shown that climate change impacts the lifespan of critical infrastructure and that the additional repair and replacement costs that arise from this risk will likely be significant over the coming decades. This project plans to enhance and expand the capabilities of the ESTCP-funded WELDER decision support tool () to address these natural hazards. WELDER 1.0, which is under the final stages of development, allows DoD users to visualize extreme weather/climate change projections and model the likelihood, severity, and expected building damage caused by these extreme events. This information can then be used to estimate the effects on building and component degradation profiles, adjust repair and/or replacement schedules, re-prioritize maintenance strategies, and inform budgetary decisions. The primary objectives of WELDER 2.0 are to reduce uncertainty around the climate projections, produce more accurate Work Action reports/recommendations in BUILDER, assist users with complex decisions around facility adaptation; record observed natural hazard-related impacts to infrastructure; integrate the tool with the new Enterprise Sustainment Management System (ESMS) platform which BUILDER will reside; and expand outreach activities to existing and prospective users.less",2023,‐,
